This Oaks Senior Living report serves as a one stop shop to review financial performance and select KPIs for all levels of the organization.  It provides detailed level of operating performance and financial health of each of the business units along with a consolidated view of the same store portfolio.  Which are the communities that Oaks Senior Living operated for a full 12 months last year as it reduces the noise in any year over year comparisons and widely used in the industry.  This report also serves as the basis for a benchmarking tool that allow comparisons of like kind business units to facilitate discussions around best practices with a focus on improving operating efficiencies.  I developed both the Operation Analysis Report and the benchmarking tool based on criteria from the CEO, Bear Mahon and CFO, Drew Williams.
